This is a spreadsheet for calculating a set of resistor values for the Figure 1 circuit in https://www.edn.com/gold-plated-pwm-control-of-linear-and-switching-regulators.
These resistors place a minimum limit on the ciruit's output voltage taking the tolerances of the resistors and the regulator's reference voltage into account. 
The spreadsheet supercedes the list of equations in the How It Works section.
It reflects the concerns listed at the end of the article in the Addendum section.
